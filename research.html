                <p>
                    HPC:<br>
                    My current focus is on integration of HPC with DBMS concepts for data intensive computations.<br>
                    I focus on making scientific array data available using declarative language and advanced query processing capabilities.

                    DB:<br>
                    My work with <a href="http://db.cse.ohio-state.edu" target="_blank"> the OSU DB Research Group</a> relates to interactive DBMS engines.<br>
                    We explore the affect interactive databases have on the DB Engine design. <br />
                    For this research area, I developed a database engine (storage component and execution engine) that is able to satisfy our (high) performance needs for interactive queries.  <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    AI:<br>
                    I developed an efficient hand detection and tracking algorithm/mechanism. It is implemented within an iPhone app.<br>
                    The whole purpose of this work was to explore efficient ways to detect objects on devices with limited processing abilites.<br><br>
                    In addition, I worked on improving sampling performance over a Bayesian Network with all discrete distributions.

                <h2>Dissertation</h2>
                <!-- <a href="">Read the dissertation</a><br /> -->
                The dissertation will be available to read soon, after formally published by The Ohio State University.<br />
                In the dissertation you will find all the work I have completed as part of the Ph.D. program.
                A few of my published works has been done "for fun", and were not counted towards the degree.

                        Sckeow: An Optimizer for Multi-Level Join Execution of Skewed and Distributed Array Data (Roee Ebenstein, Gagan Agrawal)<br>
                        In this work we target the optimization of join queries over data that becomes skewed during query execution. <br>
                        We introduce a new execution and optimization approach for distributed querying of such queries (our approach generates an ideal execution plan directly, in most cases, decreasing the query evaluation effort).

                        In this work we introduce analytical functions over scientific array data. <br>
                        While introducing the new functionality, we thoroughly discuss method for efficient (distributed) execution of the new type of queries.

                        In this work we developed an efficient mechanism to execute joins with range based join criteria.<br>
                        We use modified structure of BitMap indexes with WAH compression.

                        In this work we have developed a cost based scheme for optimization of data movement for query execution in distributed environments.<br>
                        The system include data movement cost and penalties for networking and mechanisms to prune data movement options, which results in realistic and practical option spanning for distribution analysis and cost evaluation. <br>

                        In this paper we discuss modifications of a DBMS engine to support highly interactive workloads. <br>
                        We develop a new cyclic scan engine for joins, and present two new novel join algorithms that are intended to provide results in interactive time frames.
